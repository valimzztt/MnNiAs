"""
    Script that generates random structures using the CLEASE package
    The initial structures are generated using the CLEASE method  ns.generate_gs_structure(), which generates two structures at the extrema and then generates completely random structures
    We can change the code so that instead of generating completely random structures, we can generate GS structures
